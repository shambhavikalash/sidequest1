# ANIMUS

## Concept

A cognitive-heritage interface that allows users to reconstruct lived experience, memory patterns, and ancestral narrative using multimodal data.

Think: Assassin’s Creed Animus, but grounded in neuroscience, AI, and digital anthropology.

## Core Idea

Human identity is not isolated.

It is layered.

Genetic memory, cultural inheritance, behavioral repetition, trauma cycles, and narrative archetypes all leave measurable traces.

ANIMUS is a system that:

- ingests biometric data (EEG, HRV, eye tracking)
- processes personal archives (photos, journals, voice notes)
- maps cultural lineage (language, geography, ritual)
- applies AI narrative synthesis

to simulate historically plausible experiential timelines.

Users don’t “relive” ancestors.

They explore probability-weighted reconstructions.

Memory as model.

History as interface.

## Inputs

- wearable data
- written memory fragments
- family records
- geographic ancestry
- cultural metadata
- personal creative output

---

## Output

Interactive immersive environments representing:

- emotional states
- generational patterns
- identity formation paths
- alternative life trajectories

Not games.

Introspective simulations.

---

## Use Cases

- trauma therapy
- identity research
- cultural preservation
- creative writing
- historical education
- personal meaning-making

---

## Ethics Layer

Mandatory.

- no deterministic claims
- full user ownership of data
- no behavioral prediction markets
- no emotional exploitation
- anonymized collective datasets

Only consent.

## Philosophy

You are not one self.

You are a stack of unfinished stories.

ANIMUS just gives you a way to look.
